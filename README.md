# Tetris Clone

A simple Tetris clone created over a weekend in C++ using Raylib.  
This project intentionally avoids a lot of C++ features, opting for a more C-style approach.  

If you want to explore the code, a good place to start could be: `src/main.cpp`.  

## Running the Project
To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:  

```console
$ make run
```

## Requirements
- **G++ (GCC)**  
    The compiler used for this project.  It can be changed in the Makefile if desired.  
- **Make**  
    The build tool for this project.  
- **Raylib**  
    The necessary Raylib files are included in the project under `vendor/raylib-5.0_linux_amd64`.
